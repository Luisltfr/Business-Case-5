# Business-Case-5
## For each challenge, the team built a folder with multiple notebooks corresponding to the steps taken in the analysis:
1. Preprocessing 
2. Point-of-sale quarterly Analysis
3. Clustering
4. Forecasting

The fold "Datasets" contains the 4gb dataset we ended up with after the preprocessing step.

The file "Report" contains the 10 pages report.
Finally, in the presentation file you can find the 5 mins group presentation slides.
