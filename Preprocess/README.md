### Main steps in this part of notebooks:
1-The main dataset was divided 1st in chunks of 1 million so we could preprocess it.
2-column by column the unnecessary text was removed
3-We passed each column to csv so we would not lose them
4-We tested if the datasets were ok 
5-Divided the column measures into 'values' and 'units' cutting in half the size
6-Checking some values
